# Smart-Attendance-System

The basic problem that we face in our day to day lives is the attendance that is to be taken in schools & colleges. Almost 5-10 minutes are wasted in every lecture for this minute task that is attendance.
Nowadays, almost every classroom is equipped with the CCTV camera. So, Basically we carved out a way with resources already available. We integrated the face recognition and detection system in camera which automatically detects the faces and automatically marks the attendance of the student.
Here, this is totally focused on the system and there is no human intervention.
This is a smart attendance system which solely works automatically without human intervention. The attendance of the person is marked directly into the sheet.
Smart Attendance System works through a webcam in which it recognizes the face and marks the attendance directly into the sheet which makes our attendance system more robust and efficient.
This not only can used for attendance system  but also for the security purposes too.
